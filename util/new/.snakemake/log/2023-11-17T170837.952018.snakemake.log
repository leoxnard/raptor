MissingOutputException in rule all in file /srv/public/leonard/raptor/util/new/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/srv/data/leonard/test_run_snakemake/1024.out
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
